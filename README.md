# php-register-login-number2
This project is a very simple template used for login and register. And the html-css format is also free. Global standards are used here for coding. This project is included with the database. A standard authentication has been created so that the user can register and log in well. When the user completes the registration, a confirmation email will be sent to him and he must click on that link to be activated. I created it with phpMailer. There is also a possibility to change the password so that the user can, for example, change his password within 15 minutes by using the email sent to him to confirm that the user himself has sent this request. I created a raw php template that you can use for store, blog, and news projects. But it goes without saying that it also needs development.
